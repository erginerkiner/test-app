This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) test project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to fetch data from a movie database with APIs.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

then you can see the app on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
